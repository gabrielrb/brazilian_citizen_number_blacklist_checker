# Brazilian Citizen Number Blacklist Checker


With this app you can not only check if a "CPF" number is included in a blacklist, but also add or remove said number from that blacklist.

# Structure and Features

The first thing you will see on the application's home page will be a search form, where you can search by "CPF" number.
- If the number you are looking for is in a valid "CPF" format, you will see the result below the form, indicating whether the number is blocked or free.
- If it is blocked, it means that it is blacklisted, and the option to remove it from there will appear.
- Otherwise, if the number is not in the list, the option to add it will appear.
